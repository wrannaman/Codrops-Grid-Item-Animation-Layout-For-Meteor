              Yelp in real time. HoppScotch allows you to find out in real time how people are rating a
              bar or restaurant. You can see from the heat map where ratings are available. Users can
              also contribute to the ratings by checking in to the bar or restaurant they are at. The
              app will automatically allow a user to rate a location based on their gps. This ensures
              only people physically at a place can rate it, and participate in the chat room.

              Tinder for cancer donations. If that doesn’t raise an eyebrow, I don’t know what will.
              The idea is a type of shock statement playing on pop culture and colliding that with
              the meaningful act of donating to people with cancer. The platform will be focused on
              microdonations towards individuals, organizations, or types of cancer.
